The source of password creation on the web is written in HTML, CSS, JS languages.

This project is on the web and is executed with a browser.

As you know, the more specific your password is,

the less likely it is to be guessed and, as a result,

the more secure it is. Consider a simple example:

you have some documents and valuables that you put in a safe with a regular lock. Of course,

it will be very easy for thieves to open this lock. Now, if you replace the lock of this box with password locks or use a safe with a professional lock,

what will happen?!

It is clear that opening these locks will take time or even be impossible for thieves.

Therefore, in order to preserve information in the digital world,

it is important and necessary to update the password and have a complex password.

The best way to prevent the disclosure of personal information is to create hard,

complex passwords and use software such as KeePass and LastPass to remember them,

which should be used when creating passwords for email,

user accounts, and even after purchasing a host for your panel password. Consider.

Choosing 123456 as a password is not a good option unless you like your personal information to be easily accessible to hackers! Maybe this is the worst password that can be chosen,

but worse than this number is the word password.

Statistics show that most of the hacked emails had this password,

even the phrase Passw0rd using the number 0 instead of the letter o is not smart enough and it is ranked 18th among the most dangerous passwords

Whether it is uppercase or lowercase letters or symbols,

and we can determine the length of the password.

For online accounts of any platform,

a longer and safer password can be used instead of simple passwords for greater security of your accounts.

In this project is a site where people can copy and use completely secure passwords for their accounts.

For a long time I wanted a site that could generate long passwords and a combination of numbers and symbols that were secure and this site does exactly that.

Important points in choosing a password ;

Preferably, do not set your password in places where different people may work with the system, places such as universities, internet cafes, etc.

Pay attention to check your system in terms of security and make sure that the antivirus is updated

Do not choose your password simply. Use a combination of letters in creating a password (spaces, numbers, special symbols @#$%^ and...)

Do not use the same passwords for several different places, because if one of them is hacked, there is a possibility that the other account will be compromised.

Never use your personal information (name, surname, phone number, date of birth, etc.) for your password.

One of the ways to leak your information is to fill out fake forms by mistake, to avoid this, pay attention to your url, which must belong to the host site you want.
